    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, 
    and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[8] As a result of farming, deforestation, and
     other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it 
     once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[9][10] A 2007 report 
     showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.
     [11] By December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 
     zoos in 13 countries.[12] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there 
     are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[11] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis 
     estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[13] Some reports also 
     show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.[14] By March 2015, 
     the wild giant panda population had increased to 1,864 individuals.[15] In 2016, it 
     was reclassified on the IUCN Red List from "endangered" to "vulnerable",[1] affirming
      decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassi
      fied the giant panda as vulnerable.[16]

The giant panda has often served as China's national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda
 coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics.
